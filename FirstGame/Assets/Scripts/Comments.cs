//declaring a function creates a new function
	// ex: void Start() {lines of code}
//this function can contain lines of code which causes the program to do something
//function calls cause the function to run
	//print("something")
//A class is like a box and can contain functions
	//public class Comments : MonoBehaviour { void Start() {...}}
//functions can also contain more functions and function calls
//Class is an object classification
//You must have open and closed {} per object
//void is a function that is void or empty or null
public class Comments : MonoBehaviour {

	// Use start for initialization
	// Update is called once per frame
	//When something runs into something else
	/*void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
	{
		
	}*/
